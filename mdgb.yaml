#user input values

 parameters:
  complex_parameter_filename: [] # list of topology file of a complex. ex: [directory/path/solute1.parm7, directory/path/solute2.parm7] 
  complex_coordinate_filename: [] # list of coordinate file of a complex 
  executable:  # executable machine for MD choices :[sander, sander.MPI, pmemed, pemed.MPI] ex: sander
  mpi:  # number of core for CPU run.  
  restraint_type: # choices: [ 1: CoM-CoM, 2: CoM-Heavy_Atom, 3: Heavy_Atom-Heavy_Atom, must be 1, 2 or 3 ]
  receptor_mask: # type Amber masks denoting receptor atoms in respected complex file. ex: ':CB7' (current software supports only one receptor input)
  ligand_mask: [ ]# list of Amber masks denoting ligand atoms for eache respected complex file. ex: [':M01', ':M02'] 
  freeze_restraints_forces: [ ] # list of conformational force values. ex:  [0.00390625, 0.5, 4.0] (note, orientational and conformational values need to be the same length)
  orientational_restriant_forces: [ ] # list all orientational force values. ex: [0.00390625, 0.125, 16.0 ] (note, orientational and conformational values need to be the same length)

  # mdin and restraint file currently not supported in the current software 
  mdin: # currently software does not support user specified mdin file.
  restraint_file: # currently does not support user specified restraint_file. leave as false
  
 optional_parameters:
