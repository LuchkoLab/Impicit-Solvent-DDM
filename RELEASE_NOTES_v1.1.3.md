# Release Notes - Implicit Solvent DDM v1.1.3

## Critical Bug Fixes

### COM Restraint Array Limit Fix
This release addresses a critical Fortran crash issue in flat-bottom restraints caused by excessive atom selection in the `igr1` list:

- **Fixed Fortran Array Overflow**: Limited receptor atom selection to CA atoms only (`@CA`) to prevent Fortran crashes
- **Optimized Ligand Selection**: Restricted ligand atom selection to heavy atoms only (`!@H*`) to reduce array size
- **Fixed COM Restraint Template**: Updated restraint template format to prevent parsing errors
- **Prevented Memory Issues**: Significantly reduced the number of atoms in restraint calculations

#### Technical Details
The fix addresses the core issue where:
- **Before**: All receptor atoms were selected (`self.receptor_mask`), potentially including thousands of atoms
- **After**: Only CA atoms are selected (`self.receptor_mask & @CA`), typically 10-100x fewer atoms
- **Before**: All ligand atoms were selected (`self.ligand_mask`), including hydrogens
- **After**: Only heavy atoms are selected (`self.ligand_mask & !@H*`), reducing array size

#### Template Format Fix
Updated the COM restraint template to use proper AMBER format:
```diff
- iat = -1,-2
+ iat=-1,-1,
- &end
+ /
```

## Improvements

### Restraint Generation
- **Enhanced Atom Selection**: More precise atom selection for restraint calculations
- **Reduced Computational Overhead**: Fewer atoms in restraint calculations improve performance
- **Better Memory Management**: Prevents memory allocation issues in large systems
- **Improved Stability**: Eliminates Fortran array limit crashes in complex systems

### Code Quality
- **Cleaner Template Format**: Standardized restraint template formatting
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved robustness in restraint generation
- **Optimized Selection Logic**: More efficient atom selection algorithms

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Usage
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Significantly lower memory usage for restraint calculations
- **Faster Restraint Generation**: Optimized atom selection improves generation speed
- **Better Scalability**: Handles larger protein systems without crashes

### System Compatibility
- **Large Protein Support**: Now handles systems with thousands of atoms without Fortran crashes
- **Complex Ligand Support**: Better handling of large ligand molecules
- **Improved Reliability**: More stable restraint generation across different system sizes

## Configuration Changes

### Breaking Changes
- **Atom Selection**: Receptor restraints now use CA atoms only (previously all atoms)
- **Template Format**: Updated COM restraint template format for better AMBER compatibility

### Migration Guide
For existing configurations:
1. No configuration changes required - the fix is automatic
2. Restraint generation will be more efficient and stable
3. Large systems that previously crashed will now work correctly

## Testing & Validation

### Test Updates
- **Re-enabled Workflow Tests**: Fixed and re-enabled comprehensive workflow tests
- **Large System Testing**: Added validation for systems that previously caused Fortran crashes
- **Restraint Generation Testing**: Verified proper atom selection and template generation
